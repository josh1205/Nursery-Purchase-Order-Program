## üìò Overview
This project was created as part of a college assignment. It is written in C++ and demonstrates **object-oriented programming**, **dynamic memory allocation**, and **operator overloading**.  

The program manages nursery stock purchase orders by reading data from a file, processing orders, applying tax rates and discounts, and outputting formatted results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Program Components

### **Classes**
- **order_record**
  - Holds plant name, county, plant cost, quantity, and calculated values (net cost, tax, discount, total cost).

- **order_class**
  - Manages an array of `order_record` objects using dynamic memory.  
  - Key features:
    - Default constructor: Reads initial data from `nursery_stock.txt`.
    - Copy constructor: Deep copy of dynamic arrays.
    - Destructor: Deallocates memory.  
    - `add()`: Adds a new order.  
    - `operator-`: Removes orders by plant name.  
    - `process()`: Calculates net cost, tax, discount, and total cost.  
    - `double_size()`: Doubles array size when full.  
    - `operator<<`: Prints all orders neatly formatted.  

### **Driver Program**
- Tests constructors, `add`, `remove`, `process`, copy constructor, and destructor.  
- Demonstrates dynamic array behavior and operator overloading.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile and Run
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`).  

```bash
# Compile
g++ main.cpp order_class.cpp -o order_manager

# Run
./order_manager
```

The program requires an input file named **`nursery_stock.txt`** with plant order data.  

**Example (`nursery_stock.txt`):**
```
owl dade 10.55 100
hibiscus broward 15.82 15
rose dade 9.99 45
carnation palm 7.99 32
rose palm 7.99 60
widow palm 25.75 5
carnation dade 12.55 10
carnation dade 12.55 8
lilly broward 6.92 150
xerabtgemum palm 13.63 50
yarrow dade 22.85 20
zenobia palm 37.19 32
zephyranthes broward 62.82 40

## ‚ú® Features
- Demonstrates **constructors, destructors, and operator overloading**.  
- Dynamic memory allocation with array resizing.  
- Tax and discount calculations based on **county** and **quantity**.  
- Input/output handling with formatted display.

## üìö Notes
- This was created as a **college project**, not for production use.  
- Demonstrates strong use of C++ OOP principles and memory management.
